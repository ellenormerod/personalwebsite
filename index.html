      <div class="flex">
        <p>
            I am a recent graduate of Fullstack Academy, a highly competitive software engineering bootcamp. Before that, I graduated University of California Santa Barbara with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. I currently work as a fellow for Fullstack Academy, helping new students learn how to become great web designers. I hope to continue to learn about software development and grow my skills in the technologies I have already picked up and to learn new ones. If you would like to know more please feel free to email me.
